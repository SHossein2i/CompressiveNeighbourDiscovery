# CompressiveNeighbourDiscovery
The file contains original MATLAB codes that simulates Reed-Muller codes and Chirp algorithms for compressed sensing-based neighbor discovery method in wireless networks. It also includes my initial slides on the topic and also my complete manuscript after simulating the system.
Simulations are following the proposed system in this paper:
L. Zhang, J. Luo, and D. Guo, "Neighbor discovery for wireless networks via compressed sensing", Elsevier, Performance Evaluation, 2013.
Please read ND_Guide (notepad file) for a guidance on the developed functions and the m-files that you need to run in order to reproduce results in the manuscript. 
All codes are developed by Hossein Hosseini, 30
